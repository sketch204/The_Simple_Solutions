    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Over the past few years I have worked on many projects. Some which killed a lot of my nerves. Other taught me many new things. Here are a few of the biggest projects that I've done in the past.
    </p>

    <h3>Lyon's Den</h3>
    <p>
        Lyon’s Den is a project that I am still working on with a good friend of mine. It is a mobile app that we made for out school to help the students find their timetable schedule more easily, have quicker access to the school calendar and many other things. We have developed this app on iOS and are currently finishing up the android version. It is a web based application, so you do need both a registered account as well as an internet connection to use the app fully. The app is integrated with Google’s <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> services to ease our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app provides many features to the users, such as the previously stated school calendar and schedule for the day. It also provides features such as announcement viewing and posting, an on demand teacher list with their contact information as well as emergency contact information on demand. The app also has integrated notifications for whenever a new announcement is posted. We have been working on this app since the beginning of July 2017 and are still working on it. In the future we want to add additional features such as classrooms where teachers can provide course specific information to the students in their classroom. As well as developing a desktop website version of this app.

    <h3>Spend it!</h3>
    <p>
        I once asked my brother, who is an accountant, to help me manage my funds a little better, because I kept finding myself in a situation where I simply ran out of money. To help me out my brother put together a spread sheet where I would enter my financial information such as my income and my spending, and the spreadsheet would calculate how much money I should spend per day. If I kept within this limit, I would have a certain amount, saved by the end of the month.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I used the spreadsheet more and more, I started to see my finances come into better state. That is when it hit me that could really be an app. Since an app will simplify the process of input and calculations by tenfold, rather than opening it in a spreadsheet on my iPhone. It also did not sound like a very big or complex project. And so began Spend it!
    </p>
    <p>
        Spend it! is an app for iOS. It currently in development and I plan on finishing it for release sometime this coming summer. Similar to the spreadsheet, the app will calculate an amount of money that you can spend per day, based on the input of your income and spendings. At the end of your pay period, if you followed the guidelines, you should have an amount of money saved up. This amount is adjustable and is set by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a very interesting project and I hope to take it even further by implementing graphs into it and making the user interface better and better as time goes on. I believe this app will can be a very useful tool for anyone and everyone and shows great potential. Perhaps some day I wont need a spreadsheet or an app to manage my funds properly.

    <h3>Rearing Ranch</h3>
    <p>
        Rearing Ranch is a small Java based game that I have developed with a good friend of mine. It was originally a final project for a Computer Science course that I was taking in high school.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a simple computer game that is targeted towards kids age 3-5 and is supped to teach them simple colours, animals and numbers. This game implements all of the things that you would expect a game to have, such as high scores, save files and even game level.
    </p>
    <p>
        We developed this project over a course of one and a half months and during that one and a half month period faced many troubles and joys. Overall this was a very educative process, considering the strict marking process of our teacher.

    <h3>Big Number</h3>
    <p>
        During my work in the Lyon’s Den project I came across the need of coming up with a hash & salt algorithm. It is basically an algorithm that destructively encrypts a string of text. In layman’s terms it is one-way encryption. While this was fairly easy to implement in Java, it proved to bit a fair challenge to implement in Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge for me, was the fact that, unlike Java, Swift provides no native framework for dealing with Big numbers. Like really BIG number. We’re talking trillions of trillions here. I could of course find and use a third-party library for dealing with this, but any library that I found was too complicated to install and was really too heavy for the operations that I needed, which were simply to add and multiply.
    </p>
    <p>
        To solve this problem I decided to create my own BigNumber class. I started off with simple operation such as addition and multiplication. I based the algorithm on the same algorithm that we are taught in grades one and two. The ones that we did on paper. For the algorithm I only needed to have addition and multiplication, but this inspired me to go further.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far I have fully developed addition and subtraction with rational and negative numbers. Multiplication with negative number works as well since it is fairly simple, but division is still in development. My plan is to as many mathematical operators as I can Exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric are at the top of my list but perhaps I’ll find out about more operator later on.
